 * After Graphite is interrupted by a merge conflict, upon continuing, there

 *
 * 1) Complete the original rebase operation.
 * 2) Sync any remaining branches from remote.
 * 3) Restack any remaining branches that were queued.
 *
 * The below object persists the queue of branches to be restacked.
 * We also store the Graphite current branch, so that we can switch back to it.
 * We need to keep track of the new parentBranchRevision for the branch that
 * hit a merge conflict, as we cannot pull this information from Git.
